# About

Inline CSS Color allows you set colors for your inline HTML style="" attributes. With this extension you can set the colors to match your current theme so your inline css will match your theme.
There is no API in the vscode extension to retrieve theme token colors so you will have to do this manually.

# Supported Languages

- HTML
- PHP (Mixed HTML)

# Example

Inline CSS style="" value colors match theme.
